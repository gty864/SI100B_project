Background

Once upon a time, a beautiful girl, Karina, was caught by monsters and carried to the Monster Dungeon, which was known as the most dangerous places in the world. As one of her bravest boyfriends, you, Gary, had no hesitation to be the Dungeon Breaker to defeat the monsters and save Karina. With the help of the licking dog and two mysterious merchants, you wanted the world to see that an abandoned boyfriend could work heart-shaking miracles……

Operation

● Use WASD keys to control the movement of characters

● Use the SPACE key to attack monsters

● Use the ENTER key to enter the game and buy props

● Use the ESCAPE key to quit the game

● Use the q key to quit the dialog

● Use the c key to change your weapon

Rules

● The Monster Dungeon has a total of 7 layers. You should survive 7 waves of monster attacks, including monsters, thugs, hulks and soldiers, and defeat the boss in the last wave. The difficulty increases with each wave. You can earn coins by killing monsters.

● Your HP is limited so you should avoid collisions with monsters and being attacked by the bullets and shockwaves.

● After surviving each wave, you are sent to the city. You can use your coins to buy props from boxes and refresh the boxes from the merchant. These props enhance your attack, HP, moving speed and attack speed. A friendly Ironman will remind you of your surviving wave if you get close to him. 

● There will be happy ending and bad ending, which depend on the licking dog.
